// STRUCTS

/*
 Difference between class and struct: basically none. Class is private by default, but a struct is public by default
 
 Only reason struct exists is due to backwards compatiability with C (which did not have structs)
 
 Now the difference becomes a usage thing. It's quite trivial. But communities have come up with differences: struct is used for old plain data, just holding a bunch of variables. Or manipulation of these variables.
 
 A class might have a 3D model and how the player moves around the map. Classes are typically a lot more complex. Usually use inheritance with class.
